    <p>The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>
<p>When writing in HTML, the <p> tag is a block element used to designate a paragraph. It is useful because Internet browsers add a bit of margin before after each element. The following sections contain information about this tag, including an example of it in use, and related attributes and browser compatibility.</p>
